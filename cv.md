## Experience

### Software Developer, Google :: 08.2020-Present

1.  **Google Kubernetes Engine - Scalability** :: 04.2021-Present

    My team works on GKE scaling capabilities. We debug any issues of that type
    occurring in a Kubernetes release and coordinate efforts that push the
    limits even further. My contributions range from developing internal tools
    for our testing infrastructure up to working on OSS Kubernetes internals.
    Also got a top score on our pinball machine.

2.  **Cloud Data Catalog** :: 08.2020-03.2021

    Co-implemented a major framework that enables automatic metadata
    synchronisation with multiple Google services, such as Cloud Dataplex. It
    reduced the cost of adding such integration ten times against what we had
    before.

### Software Developer, TravelTime :: 02.2018-06.2020

Worked on a GIS API that is based on measuring distance by time. Took ownership
of maintaining a project capable of calculating travel times between 1 and
100,000 points under 200ms. Wrote a tool that reduced map parsing time from
three weeks to two days.

### Software Development Specialist, Nokia Networks :: 09.2017-02.2018

Developed telecommunication data ETL and KPI representation. This involved heavy
exploitation of Zeppelin capabilities while feeling the burden of Spark's
runtime chaos.

### Thesis Student, SAP :: 02.2017-07.2017

Created a brand new system managing resources for Spark Streaming. The solution
was somewhat superior in results to the default one developed by Databricks -
both in terms of cluster usage and Quality of Service. This also taught me about
Spark's internal algorithms.

### Software Development Engineering Intern, Amazon :: 07.2016-09.2016

Worked with the Automated Talent Sourcing team on their candidate processing
platform. Learned Big Data toolset and refreshed Java skills in an awesome job
environment.

### Software Developer, BrightIT :: 01.2016-06.2016

Crafted enterprise-level websites with HP Teamsite, HP Idol, Scala, Play,
Docker, Puppet, Varnish, Vagrant, XSLT, etc. Learned how to work under pressure
with new technologies and issues constantly coming up. Introduced foosball and
Travis CI to the company's workflow.

### Intern, ABB :: 06.2015-11.2015

Rewritten legacy code of an optimization system that not only used GWT but was
also full of french variable names. Insisted on using technologies that I had no
idea about which allowed me to learn Scala and React. Collaborated with
scientists on project's architecture.

### Working Student, Nokia Networks :: 07.2014-05.2015

Worked on an application that was tracking changes made inside XML files that
were distributed over several VCSs. Got really burned during the first code
review and became a programming style purist. Used Play together with Java which
was also a valuable lesson.

## Education

### Psychology, Bachelor of Science :: 10.2021-Present

Learning at SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities.

### Computer Science, Master of Engineering :: 10.2012-09.2017

Graduated from Wroclaw University of Science and Technology. Wrote Master Thesis
about optimizing resource usage in Apache Spark Streaming. Also finished the
Bachelor studies at the same university and took 6th place in TOP 10 graduates
ranking. Participated in numerous programming contests (up to finals). Overall,
had a lot of fun in those years!
