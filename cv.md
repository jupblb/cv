# Michal Kielbowicz

## Experience

### Software Engineer, Waymo :: 10.2023-Present

Moving across an entire stack of Waymo One. Initially worked on adding support
for new payment methods (most notably Google Pay) and payment processors.
Currently involved in designing and building a system for fraud detection and
device-level banning.

### Software Engineer, Google :: 08.2020-10.2023

1.  **Google.org (MicroMentor)** :: 04.2023-10.2023

    Worked on a cross-platform mobile app enabling underrepresented
    entrepreneurs from MENA territory to seek mentorship when establishing their
    own businesses.

2.  **Google Kubernetes Engine** :: 04.2021-04.2023

    Let’s say a single Kubernetes node costs \$1/h. Now imagine a cluster of
    15,000 nodes. Actually, let’s have multiple such clusters, each with
    different features enabled. My team ensured such setups are supported and
    made Kubernetes even more scalable.

3.  **Cloud Data Catalog** :: 08.2020-03.2021

    Co-implemented a major framework that enables automatic metadata
    synchronization with multiple Google services, such as Cloud Dataplex. It
    reduced the cost of adding such integration ten times against what we had
    before.

### Software Developer, TravelTime :: 02.2018-06.2020

Worked on a GIS API that is based on measuring distance by time. Took ownership
of maintaining a project capable of calculating travel times between 1 and
100,000 points under 200ms. Wrote a tool that reduced map parsing time from
three weeks to two days.

### Software Development Specialist, Nokia Networks :: 09.2017-02.2018

Developed telecommunication data ETL and KPI representation. This involved heavy
exploitation of Zeppelin capabilities while feeling the burden of Spark’s
runtime chaos.

### Thesis Student, SAP :: 02.2017-07.2017

Created a brand-new system managing compute resources for Spark Streaming. My
solution performed a bit better than the default one developed by Databricks.

### Software Development Engineering Intern, Amazon :: 07.2016-09.2016

Worked with the Automated Talent Sourcing team on their candidate processing
platform. Learned Big Data toolchain and refreshed Java skills in an awesome job
environment.

### Software Developer, BrightIT :: 01.2016-06.2016

Crafted enterprise-level websites with HP Teamsite, HP Idol, Scala, Play,
Docker, Puppet, Varnish, Vagrant, XSLT, etc. Learned how to work under pressure
with new technologies and issues constantly coming up. Introduced foosball and
Travis CI to the company’s workflow.

### Intern, ABB :: 06.2015-11.2015

Rewritten legacy code of an optimization system that not only used GWT but was
also full of french variable names. Insisted on using technologies that I had no
idea about which allowed me to learn Scala and React. Collaborated with
scientists on project’s architecture.

### Working Student, Nokia Networks :: 07.2014-05.2015

Worked on an application that was tracking changes made inside XML files that
were distributed over several VCSs. Got really burned during the first code
review and became a programming style purist. Used Play together with Java which
was also a valuable lesson.

## Education

### Psychology, Bachelor of Science :: 10.2021-07.2024

Graduated from SWPS University (Warsaw). Finished entire coursework without
delays in parallel to changing jobs, moving to a new city and having a child.
With this achievement I definitely have to share credit with my wife who did a
lot to support me.

### Computer Science, Master of Engineering :: 10.2012-09.2017

Graduated from Wroclaw University of Science and Technology. Wrote Master Thesis
about optimizing resource usage in Apache Spark Streaming. Also took 6th place
in TOP 10 graduates ranking. Participated in numerous programming contests (up
to finals).
