## Experience

### 08.2020-Present :: Software Engineer, Google

1.  10.2023-Present :: Waymo

2.  04.2023-10.2023 :: **Google.org MicroMentor**

    Worked on a next-gen platform enabling underrepresented entrepreneurs from
    MENA territory to seek mentorship when establishing their own businesses.
    This project is a part of Google.org under partnership with MicroMentor
    non-profit.

3.  04.2021-04.2023 :: **Google Kubernetes Engine - Scalability**

    Let’s say a single Kubernetes node costs \$1/h. Now imagine a cluster of
    15,000 nodes. Actually, let’s have multiple such clusters and each of them
    will run with different features (ipv6, windows nodes, various load
    balancing strategies, etc.). My team ensured such setups are supported and
    carried out work that made Kubernetes even more scalable. Because of us GKE
    is a top product when it comes to stable execution of large and expensive
    workloads.

4.  08.2020-03.2021 :: **Cloud Data Catalog**

    Co-implemented a major framework that enables automatic metadata
    synchronization with multiple Google services, such as Cloud Dataplex. It
    reduced the cost of adding such integration ten times against what we had
    before.

### 02.2018-06.2020 :: Software Developer, TravelTime

Worked on a GIS API that is based on measuring distance by time. Took ownership
of maintaining a project capable of calculating travel times between 1 and
100,000 points under 200ms. Wrote a tool that reduced map parsing time from
three weeks to two days.

### 09.2017-02.2018 :: Software Development Specialist, Nokia Networks

Developed telecommunication data ETL and KPI representation. This involved heavy
exploitation of Zeppelin capabilities while feeling the burden of Spark’s
runtime chaos.

### 02.2017-07.2017 :: Thesis Student, SAP

Created a brand-new system managing resources for Spark Streaming. The solution
was somewhat superior in results to the default one developed by Databricks -
both in terms of cluster usage and Quality of Service. This also taught me about
Spark’s internal algorithms.

### 07.2016-09.2016 :: Software Development Engineering Intern, Amazon

Worked with the Automated Talent Sourcing team on their candidate processing
platform. Learned Big Data tool set and refreshed Java skills in an awesome job
environment.

### 01.2016-06.2016 :: Software Developer, BrightIT

Crafted enterprise-level websites with HP Teamsite, HP Idol, Scala, Play,
Docker, Puppet, Varnish, Vagrant, XSLT, etc. Learned how to work under pressure
with new technologies and issues constantly coming up. Introduced foosball and
Travis CI to the company’s workflow.

### 06.2015-11.2015 :: Intern, ABB

Rewritten legacy code of an optimization system that not only used GWT but was
also full of french variable names. Insisted on using technologies that I had no
idea about which allowed me to learn Scala and React. Collaborated with
scientists on project’s architecture.

### 07.2014-05.2015 :: Working Student, Nokia Networks

Worked on an application that was tracking changes made inside XML files that
were distributed over several VCSs. Got really burned during the first code
review and became a programming style purist. Used Play together with Java which
was also a valuable lesson.

## Education

### 10.2021-Present :: Psychology, Bachelor of Science

Learning at SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities.

### 10.2012-09.2017 :: Computer Science, Master of Engineering

Graduated from Wroclaw University of Science and Technology. Wrote Master Thesis
about optimizing resource usage in Apache Spark Streaming. Also finished the
Bachelor studies at the same university and took 6th place in TOP 10 graduates
ranking. Participated in numerous programming contests (up to finals). Overall,
had a lot of fun in those years!
