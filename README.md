# My CV

After many years of using [moderncv](https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv) I
decided to take a simpler approach. I've been using Pandoc recently a lot and it
has a great support for using
[markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) as language for
various document types.

## How to generate?

``` sh
# Default choice
$ make cv.pdf
# Same but without inserting style.tex
$ make cv-simple.pdf
```
